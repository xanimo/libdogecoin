 * test_raccoong_gaussian — byte-exact gate against upstream
 * p-11/lattice-hd-wallets `thrc_gauss.sample_rounded` (commit pinned in the
 * fixture header).
 *
 * The C kernel consumes a recorded SHAKE256 byte prefix and must produce the
 * same RACCOONG_N samples upstream produced from the same seed.  Any
 * mismatch indicates the mpmath / MPFR equivalence at 256-bit precision has
 * broken (or that the kernel logic drifted from upstream) — in which case
 * the port stops here and the failing index is reported.
